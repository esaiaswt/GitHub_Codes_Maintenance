# GitHub Codes Maintenance Tool

This Python application helps you maintain GitHub repositories by:
- Scanning for deprecated libraries and code patterns (especially for Colab and ML projects)
- Generating reports of imports and code deprecations
- Suggesting and optionally automating code replacements (with user permission)
- Logging all automated code changes for traceability

## Features
- **Clone any public GitHub repository**
- **Detect deprecated imports and code patterns**
- **Generate `import_report.txt` and `deprecation_report.txt`**
- **Automate code replacement with user approval**
- **Log all changes in `code_change_log.txt`**

## How It Works
1. **Clone a Repository:**
   - Run the script and enter a GitHub repository URL when prompted (unless a repo is already cloned).
   - If a repository is already cloned, you can choose to delete it and clone a new one.
2. **Scan for Deprecations:**
   - The tool scans all Python files for deprecated imports and code patterns (e.g., TensorFlow 1.x, pandas.Panel, etc.).
   - It generates `import_report.txt` (all imports and deprecated libraries) and `deprecation_report.txt` (all deprecated code patterns found).
3. **Automated Code Replacement:**
   - If deprecated code is found, you will be prompted to approve automated replacements.
   - Deprecated lines are commented out and suggestions are inserted above them.
   - All changes are logged in `code_change_log.txt`.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and Git installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the code.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
   ```powershell
   python github_maintenance.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts in the terminal.

## Example Output
```
Enter the GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/username/repo.git
Imported libraries found in the repository:
- tensorflow
- pandas
...
Deprecated libraries detected and suggestions:
- tensorflow: Upgrade to TensorFlow 2.x for better support and features.
  Suggested replacement: tensorflow>=2.0
...
The following deprecated code patterns were found:
1. cloned_repo/example.py (Line 10): tf.Session(...)
   Suggestion: Remove tf.Session and use eager execution (TensorFlow 2.x).
Do you want to automatically replace all deprecated code with the suggested replacements? (y/n):
```

## Output Files
- `import_report.txt`: List of all imports and deprecated libraries found.
- `deprecation_report.txt`: List of all deprecated code patterns and suggestions.
- `code_change_log.txt`: Log of all automated code changes (file, line, old/new code).
